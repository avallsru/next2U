# next2U
## The app that connects you with your local stores

------

### General description
**next2U** is an app to buy things from small stores by filtering by location and by kind of store.

### Necessity that resolves
Big companies such as Fnac, elCorteIngles, the big supermarkets and similar have their own on-line platform and delivery system. But small local stores donâ€™t have enough resources (neither technological nor logistics) to achieve that goal.
Being inspired by other platforms (like ones which join different restaurants), **next2U** seeks to become a platform where little stores could easily sell online and deliver their products to their customers (if they want it).
